**PotatoDoc: AI-powered Potato Disease Classifier**
**PotatoDoc** is a project that utilizes the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to classify potato diseases. This README provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples.

**Motivation:**

Potato is a vital food source globally, but various diseases can significantly impact its production. Early and accurate disease detection is crucial for implementing effective control measures and minimizing crop losses. PotatoDoc aims to address this challenge by providing an AI-based tool for potato disease classification.

**Features:**

_Image classification_: Identify various potato diseases from images.
_User-friendly interface (optional):_ Integrate the model into a web application or GUI for ease of use (implementation not included in this repository).
Setup:

1 **Clone the repository:**

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PotatoDoc.git
Use code with caution.

**2 Install dependencies:**

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

3. **Download pre-trained model (optional):**

If you plan to use a pre-trained model, download it from the provided link (replace with the actual download link) and place it in the appropriate directory within the repository.
If you want to train your own model, follow the training instructions mentioned below.
**Usage:**

**Single image prediction:**

Python
from potato_disease_classifier import predict_disease

**Replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the path to your potato image**
prediction = predict_disease('path/to/your/image.jpg')
print(prediction)
Use code with caution.

**Real-time prediction (optional):**

Develop a script or application that captures frames from a webcam or video stream.
Use the predict_disease function on each captured frame to obtain real-time predictions.

**Training (optional):**

1 **Prepare your dataset:**

Collect a dataset of potato images labeled with their corresponding diseases.
Ensure the dataset is balanced and representative of the different diseases you want to classify.

**2 Train the model:**

Modify the provided training script to fit your specific dataset and desired model architecture.
Train the model on your dataset using appropriate training parameters.
